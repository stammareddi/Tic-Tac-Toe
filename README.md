# Tic-Tac-Toe
Created a tic tac toe game where user chooses one of the q<0-9> boxes and after the computer generates a random number between 
0-9 and assgins it to that query. The winning combo is done by creating a 2D array with all the possible outcomes to win

4 helper methods 
grid --> gives a array of all the divs in the index.html
qNumId --> removes the q in the div id and replaces with a ''
emptyQs --> tells us which quadrents are empty 
allSame --> checks if the elements in the winning combo array are the same telling us if it is a winner
